## Project Overview

VideoStreamingApp is an innovative application designed to provide users with a seamless video streaming experience, built with **React** for a dynamic frontend and **Node.js** for a robust backend. Utilizing **Firebase** for authentication and storage, this application enables users to upload, stream, and manage their videos efficiently.

The architecture consists of two primary components:
1. **Frontend**: Developed using React, it offers user-friendly interfaces and smooth interactions through state management via Redux.
2. **Backend**: Built on Node.js with Express framework, managing API requests and database interactions effectively.

## 🌟 Features
- Secure user authentication utilizing **Firebase**.
- Video uploads from user devices with real-time feedback.
- Streaming capabilities for various video formats.
- Commenting system enabling community interaction on videos.
- Responsive design facilitating use on both desktops and mobile devices.

## 🗂️ API Endpoints

| Endpoint          | Method   | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| `/api/auth/signin`     | POST     | Authenticate user login                |
| `/api/auth/signup`     | POST     | Register new user                      |
| `/api/videos`          | GET      | Retrieve list of uploaded videos       |
| `/api/videos/upload`   | POST     | Upload new video                       |
| `/api/comments/:videoId`  | GET      | Fetch comments associated with a video |

## ⚙️ Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VideoStreamingApp.git
    cd VideoStreamingApp/client && npm install  # For frontend dependencies
    
    cd ../server && npm install  # For backend dependencies
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory to store environment variables required by your configurations.

3. Start both servers:
    - Run the server (`server`):
      ```bash
      npm start     # from within server directory
      ```
      
    - Run the client application (`client`):
      ```bash
      npm start     # from within client directory  
      ```

## 🚀 Usage

Once both servers are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. The following actions can be performed by users:
1. Sign in or register as a new user.
2. Upload videos directly through the web interface.
3. Stream available videos while engaging in discussions through comments.

### Example Code for Uploading Videos (Frontend)

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { uploadVideo } from '../redux/videoSlice';

const Upload = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleUpload = (file) => {
    dispatch(uploadVideo({ file }));
  };

  return (
    <input type="file" onChange={(e) => handleUpload(e.target.files[0])} />
  );
};
```
