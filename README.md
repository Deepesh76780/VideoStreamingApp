## Project Overview
VideoStreamingApp is a robust video streaming application designed to facilitate the uploading, management, and streaming of videos in a user-friendly environment. Built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, this application leverages Firebase for secure storage and authentication services.

The architecture follows a client-server model where:
- **Frontend**: Developed with React, it handles user interactions and UI rendering.
- **Backend**: Built on Node.js with Express, it manages API requests and communicates with the Firebase database for data operations.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- User authentication through email and password.
- Ability to upload videos along with metadata (title, description).
- Video streaming capabilities with support for various formats.
- Commenting functionality on videos to enhance user interaction.
- Responsive design ensuring usability across devices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Node.js (14.x or higher recommended)
2. npm or yarn

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install # or yarn install 
   ```

### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install # or yarn install 
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Client Application  
Start the React app from the `client` directory:
```bash    
npm start # or yarn start 
```

### Running the Server Application  
Open another terminal, navigate to the `server` directory, and start your Node.js server:
```bash    
npm start # or yarn start 
```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` for the client and `http://localhost:8801/api/` for API access.
