## Project Overview

**VideoStreamingApp** is a modern video streaming application engineered to provide users with an intuitive platform for uploading, streaming, and managing videos. Built using **React** as the frontend framework, **Node.js** for backend services, and powered by **Firebase** for secure storage and user authentication, this app aims to deliver a seamless user experience.

The architecture consists of a client-server model where:
- The **client-side**, developed in React, manages the UI components, routing with `react-router`, and state management using `Redux`.
- The **server-side**, developed in Node.js with Express, handles API requests, user authentication via JWTs, and interacts with a MongoDB database through Mongoose middleware.

## 🌟 Features

- User authentication and account management via Firebase.
- Real-time video uploads with cloud storage.
- Stream videos seamlessly without interruptions.
- Interactive comments section for user engagement.
- Personalized video recommendations based on viewing history.

## 📡 API Endpoints

Below are the main API endpoints that can be used to interact with the server:

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                         |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/videos`     | Retrieve all videos                 |
| POST   | `/api/videos`     | Upload a new video                  |
| GET    | `/api/users/:id`  | Get user details                    |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate users                  |

## 🛠️ Installation

To install VideoStreamingApp locally on your machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VideoStreamingApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd VideoStreamingApp/client
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```

4. Navigate into the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../server 
   ```

5. Install backend dependencies:

    ```

## 🚀 Usage

Once installed, you can start both the client and server applications:

### Start Client Application:
Navigate back to the client directory (if not already there) and run:
```bash
npm start --prefix client/
```

### Start Server Application:
Open another terminal window and navigate to the server directory then run:
```bash
npm start --prefix server/
```
> The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🗃️ Database Schema

The application utilizes MongoDB models for handling users and videos.

### User Model Example
```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true }
});
```

### Video Model Example
```javascript
const VideoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  url: { type: String },
  uploadedAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});
```
